                He scored an 8 out of 10 on the HEAL Test. A measurement tool developed by Cambridge psychologists to determine the potential of childhood trauma -- the higher the score the greater likelihood. Eight different forms of abuse. Though, if you’d ask him it didn’t seem too bad at the time. Only lonely, he’d say. Maybe that’s where it all started: this almost naive, and admirable, penchant for optimisms and great romances and loves. Sitting in the corner of a dimly lit room, he would read prosaic classical writings while listening to modern disco and house inspired ballads and dance music. In the Count of Monte Cristo, he didn’t want to be the Count. He was, by all counts, Morrellian; a feverish and delusional and star-crossed passion stricken red-hued chromantic.

                The three of us were at a Six Flags roller coaster park near Los Angeles waiting in a line. The train raced, tracks roaring and the people screaming, above our heads. A shoe hit him in the face. Properly hit him. Grimacing, he caught it in the flat of his palm. He carried it through the line and, in handing it to one of the park attendants, the owner of the weapon came hopping over while laughing, colorful socks exposed, very grateful and very beautiful.

                We would see them throughout the day. In lines, getting food, resting in the shade at the top of a steep path. Often, while we waited, he would become silent in the midst of our conversations. Pensive thoughts aimed towards a different atmosphere.

                “Helen.” He would whisper.

                The regret in him built up and exploded in a craving for desserts. We ate funnel cakes together in the hot night near the exit of the park hoping she would walk by. And she did. And he stood, departed, spoke quickly, and returned to us a new and strange man.

                “True love,” he would say, “Doesn’t exist. I’m a nihilist now. Every day for two years you two live in happiness and harmony. All that effort, for what? Memories? Shadows? No. I’m a nihilist now. Now, I see things for what they are and love for what it really is. Love is like having thumbs. And the pain of living without love is like having them amputated. I can’t hold anything. I can’t hold myself up. I can’t properly pet dogs now, I have no thumbs.”

                For awhile, in the darkest hours of the night, we could find him in the living room with the lights off, television muted, staring at his hands, his thumbs tucked into his open palms. He would shake his head and pretend to be Edward Scissorhands; opening and shutting his four fingers, snipping at the open air. Unless we called him Edward he would pretend to ignore us. He needed help opening jars, he was slow to reply to text messages, he couldn’t hold a cup of coffee, though in public he pet dogs just fine and smiled while doing so. In the middle of all his sadnesses and apprehensions it was nice to see him smile. At work his thumbs seemed to magically revive, and so too did his good mood.

                “It’s nice to have you back.” I said to him over the grinding of espresso beans. He was carefully monitoring the timing of a pour-over.

                From the open garage-type-front-door of the industrial, warm minimalist, very open very naturally designed coffee shop sitting at the bottom of a winding road, you could see the Hollywood sign. It wasn’t uncommon for groups of families and tourists to visit as they journeyed.

                “It’s almost been a year now. I have a pour-over for Madeline. She deserves to be happy. Thank you, Madeline.” She put a tip in the jar and smiled at him, “Besides. I don’t even know if she’s dating anyone.” 
            </p>

For her to make choices about her life that made her happy and I would support them, support her. She loves fashion, wants to pursue fashion, and New York is the city to do that.” He sighed weighing a small batch of beans. “In the end, she chose to move. She did what I would have wanted her to do. Even if it doesn’t include me.”

                Otis smiled and nodded. Madeline came back into the cafe and handed him her phone number on a piece of paper. She was a very handsome woman. But once he put the paper into his pocket I never saw it again. Neither did he.

                Our co-coworker played their music during a shift and for the three of us it was a revelation. They were a lesser known Korean-Pop girl-group, but their production themes gravitated towards house styles and smooth electronic dance while touching on lyrics empowering young women to be and love themselves and not need or rely on any man to make their lives or themselves complete.

                Digesting the entirety of their modest discography, constantly replaying their music videos in our apartment, and putting their faces as our phone wallpapers, we dove deep into some esoteric and lovely feelings. They appeared frequently on Korean game shows, and we would gather excitedly to watch on a weekly basis. We made sure to go through all their content, new and old, never allowing our attentions to wane.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                The way the Korean-Pop subversive-universe operates is by constantly and relentlessly releasing content; less of a schedule and more a barrage. An assault in the form of music, tours, television shows, music videos, merchandise, posts on social media, interviews, vlogs, or live streams forever changing the landscape of our reptilian brains. By the time any group was a year old, there was a near infinite amount of content for anyone to consume. By doing this, the entertainment companies fostered addiction. There was always something to look forward to, always something new to be had. And if the record company was smart, they grew enclaves of beautiful women whose talent not only complemented each other, but whose personalities worked in synergy as well. This simple yet effective methodology yielded content that was seamless, kept drama minimal, and who they are as individuals could be conveyed naturally without any direction or moderation. Nothing is forced. Their senses of humor, their candor for one another as a family, the way they dress and speak, and their own uniqueness, in the constantly shifting tide of the k-pop market, their greatest strength.

                We would watch these six beautiful women sing and dance and gather and laugh and eat, and watch, and watch, and fall asleep on each other’s shoulders, and wake up and work. And at work we would watch and listen all the same.

                It was strange — having seen and studied their expressions and mannerisms for the past year, and now seeing it unmanaged and unrehearsed and unfiltered. There was no clean edit to emphasize their joy or clever post-processed color-grading to enhance their beauty; only them; raw, simply summerly dressed, barefaced, perfect, Nouveau.

                Miura held Trinity’s hand lightly, her thumb gently stroking Trinity’s skin. Her eyes watered at the perfectly even  feuillitege from the croissant in the pastry display. I’m so hungry, she mummed in Korean — even her despondence traced optimism. Her posture unfixed and loose, movements made in tandem with the music, irreverent to any expectation save for that of her own truth. Each of her small movements and expressions a microcosm of emotion; so much conveyed yet unsaid, explicit in their subtext alone. She gave each individual thought its deserved attention, no moment without consequence. Each look garnished to her group members filled with love, and each passing glance glazed with wonder. Constantly and unconsciously searching for something while never lacking or wanting of anything.

                I heard him singing outside. His own lyrics to the rhythm of the music currently playing.

                “Pizza? Me!” Miura raised her hand instantly and turned around, “Pizza, pizza, pizza!” She laughed rhythmically.

            <p class="indent up">
                They took steps toward another; his, soft and measured; her’s akin to skips, a god over water. Otis opened the box and they peered inside. Together, they admired the simple pizza adorned with pineapples and jalapeños; a favorite they shared.
            </p> <br>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Really? I can have a little?” She casted.

                Leif set down his amazement and readied two tables  and six chairs near the large open windows. Otis set the pizzas down for them, as well as the pastries and sweets they desired along with anything complimentary we thought they might enjoy, and I brought over small plates and utensils and napkins. There was an excited silence between us as we made their coffees, and a wonderful cascade of gratitude as we brought them to the table. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Your hand was trembling the whole time.” I said to Leif.

                Otis was looking at the floor and very far away. Miura laughed behind him and he smiled, rosebuds in his earlobes pluming.

                I peered over his shoulder. She took a large bite from a slice and delighted at the iced americano he made for her with care.

                A small rush of customers accompanied the mid-afternoon sun. The distraction a welcome tamp to our growing elation. This was our favorite time of day: bright sunlight bounced off the polished concrete walls and floors, off the natural wooden accoutrements, igniting any glee that threatened to simmer — Nouveau glowed.

                Otis took the time to blend honeyed cream with fresh lavender. And in toasting a sampling of fresh bread, with a healthy coating of French butter and brown sugar, the smell of the cafe became sweet.

                Rin and Trinity came to the counter, arm in arm, and asked if one of us could take a picture for them. I was currently in the middle of an order and though Leif didn’t seem too busy, I called for Otis.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                Smiling shyly, to hide an even larger smile, he walked beside them. Together, they spoke casually. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                He took the pictures expertly. Squatting dramatically, his legs dilapidated and awkwardly bent, repositioning himself to capture Nouveau in the best possible lighting, and Nouveau simply doing what they do best: posing, laughing, being themselves. As if they were treasures, Nouveau held up the various pastries and drinks to the lens. Miura held up an entire box of pizza and smiled wonderfully. He came back in a rush.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “I asked if we can take pictures with them.” I jumped. “Where’s Leif?” 
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                The three of us gathered nervously. We didn’t have anyone to take the photographs but I figured we could freeze and crop the security camera footage. I told Selene of our plan and, in translating, Nouveau seemed to enjoy the idea. 
                She counted down. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Hana, dul, set!” I took a kneeling position at the front beside Selene and Water, my palms clasped together, the repose of deep prayer. Leif, at the back near Rin, leaned against the wall looking very cool and casual. And Otis, with Miura, pointed confidently at the camera, winking professionally. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Sexy! Sexy pose!” She instructed. “Hana, dul, set!”

                We laughed together after unfreezing and a great round of thanks were exchanged. Otis tapped on my shoulder and handed me his camera.

                Miura was waiting at the footbed of an ancient light readying a pair of large sunglasses. Together, they posed nonchalantly. Disinterested in anything save for, and savoring, the moment. For the final pictures she removed her glasses. They looked at another and, at the instance of the birth of a great star and shared laughter, I took the photos.

                A layer of static over the video gave it the feeling of a transmission from a distant constellation, and the softly pixelated resolution grafted to the memory an aged patina — a warm vignette that made me doubtful of reality; perhaps it had all been a fauvian, fever-driven, impression. But there they were, and there we were; laughing together, thankful together, existing in a singular space and time together together.

                They asked us to not upload any pictures to social media until the fall when they would be debuting a set of vlogs dedicated to their short vacation and adventures in Los Angeles. We shared a happy secret with Nouveau, and that made us all quite joyous.

                I caught him once trying to run through the wall. Another time he was petting a stray cat outside of our store while crying with the small cat meowing softly in return. He took every chance to tell us how much we mean to him, and he danced and sang to his favorite music as often as he could no matter where he was, and when one of his heroes died he celebrated their lives by eating his favorite food and drinking his favorite soju while sobbing beautifully and shifting viscerally between deep sorrow and profound levity. He seemed to be at the edge of a prophecy bequeathed to him overnight.

                “Do you think sharks talk amongst themselves about how delicious tuna is?” He asked us once. “Do you think some dolphins are mean to their kids? If you mix all the colors in light, you get white — when you mix all the emotions in life, what do you get?” He would ask these questions never expecting an answer. Just thinking to think. “Something extraordinary, undoubtedly.”

                The pictures and videos resonated marvelously, reviving what nominal sensation of Nouveau lingered outside of Korea, engendering in small circles what we had always known: Nouveau was. Pre-order sales for their forthcoming album surpassed that of the larger and more popular groups. Their newest single breached the upper atmosphere of north-american music charts, they became brand ambassadors for the world’s pre-eminent avant-garde Antwerp-based designer, and announced their first world tour in three years since their debut. If one had the right vantage point, Nouveau was seemingly everywhere.

                Otis showed me a profile with videos and pictures of food and travel with captions written in Korean. Most sentences ended in a barrage of exclamation points and  were further punctuated by emoticon images of flowers and animals and hearts and other honeyed exuberances. Whoever the profile belonged to, they seemed to enjoy painting in their free time, and eating pizza, and oft traveled with five other, likely beautiful, women. As he scrolled silently through the feed I saw that he had taken the liberty of favoriting a number of the pictures and captions.

            <p class="indent up italic">
                “No matter how small the possibility that something may happen, those odds are infinitely greater than it never having the possibility to occur at all. For instance, the odds of me being struck by lightning may be one in a thousand, but the odds of me never having the potential of being stricken at all is…one in near infinity. For that potential to even exist, I can never be in or around rain or clouds, or even have lived on Earth or any other planet it may rain on. It’s so much more fun to believe in all the beautiful things that might happen if you’re curious enough, if you choose to believe. And even if I did get struck by lightning, it’d be a damned good story.”

Where it doesn’t rain. Where it’s nice and dry. And hot. Nice and dry aged, and seasoned like a perfect steak. I’ll never use metal utensils ever again — the risk of being hit by lightning is too great. Look at the chaos you’ve strewn. I can’t eat a filet mignon anymore because of you.”

                Waiting on a moment to moment, second to millisecond basis, makes time move very quite slowly. As if at the precipice of a domineering and infinite black hole beyond the edge of our galaxy, left only to spectate as time stretches around you, sifting between abstractions of mutilation and elation. Everybody you love moves quickly around you, making cinema of your distress, while you’re in between times, stuck in a stagnation of your own design.

                He floated happily to the storeroom, where the boxes of Nouveau merchandise were located, and opened fresh bags of shirts and sweaters and socks and pins and posters. In his arms, he carried each ounce of nectar to the front of the cafe and pollenated the shelves it with his treasures. Due to the somewhat viral nature of the pictures and videos from the coffee shop, Nouveau’s record company decided to utilize the realty and asked us to host a small pop-up location with exclusive Los Angeles merch for the upcoming tour. We took the promotion seriously and launched ourselves into the role of evangelists, printing pamphlets and custom stickers to hand out to customers, constantly playing their new album, and oft evocating the greater truths and bountiful harmony of Nouveau.

                Great and happy emotions flooded, rinsing the cafe in  holy feelings. Fans from throughout southern california migrated to our small store, picking and choosing their favorite items of their favorite members.

                “An iced americano. Would you like anything else?” The customer adjusted her sunglasses and ordered a few more drinks. “Thank you, Mary. Nouveau’s concert is tomorrow night, there are still a few tickets available and their new album available to stream on all platforms.” A small group of fans marched around the merchandise, their excitement buzzing. After paying she leaned against the counter adjacent to our espresso machine. Behind me, she asked Otis about some of the items in stock, and he walked with her to the display. Together, they moved slowly and mused softly at the items and at one another. He pointed at the back of his hooded sweater, printed on it a half-tone portrait of her face. She mewed, clapping her hands, and took a picture of him against the shelf.

                Leif and I closed up and drove to Beverly Hills. We found parking on Almont and walked down Melrose, through a crowd and a cloud of sitting construction dust, toward Giorgio’s Atelierante. It was a warm night and the sky at dusk was a priceless shade of blue sitting restlessly between black and orange-brown and purple, and, between jaundiced clouds, the moon was a pearly red. Somewhere in the distance, the sun was setting, but in front of us, a warmth breathed new.

                They were holding hands outside of the restaurant under a dim light, smiling voraciously, looking very romantic in matching sweatsuits. She saw us before he did and greeted us handsomely as we walked between another small party.

                The hostess walked us to the patio and past many tables before sitting us towards the rear wall and the darkest part of the restaurant. She took a seat at the corner, her back facing the public. They sifted through a menu together as if it were a museum, enticed by all. That was the only part of the meal that was silent between us. After the waiter took our orders, even through our meals and desserts, we talked  easily through the night. She asked many questions and spoke as if she knew everything about us. Questioning with earnest interest about our small lives, and how our unique passions were progressing. He listened tightly to her voice, to our answers, and everything else. We shared all our food, all our thoughts, and happinesses in this small respite time gifted to us. She lowered her glasses only when he spoke that she might see clearly his wild expressions, and leaned into him during any lengthy tangents of thought. They were a flame, prehistoric in their shape — one the universe had taken great care to keep alive.
